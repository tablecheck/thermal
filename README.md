# Thermal

Thermal printer support for Ruby. Used to print receipts, chits, tickets, labels, etc.

### Features

- Simple and opinionated API. **It just worksâ„¢**
- Generates **rich text, image, and QR codes** for thermal printers.
- Supports a broad range of **makers and models** (Epson, Star Micronics, Brother, PBM, Zijiang, etc.)
- Automatic **multi-lingual** codepage support, including support for **CJK extended character sets**.
- **Simple DSL** for rich text output formatting.
- **Graceful degradation** of features based on printer capabilities.

### Optional Features

- **HTML-to-text support**
  - Requires [nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/) gem.
- **QR code generation**
  - Requires [rqrcode](https://github.com/whomwah/rqrcode) gem.
- Support for **Stargraphic pixel-only printer** with system-side font rasterization.
  - See requirements below.

### Supported Output Formats

- Epson ESC/POS
  - Industry standard used by most thermal printers
- Star Micronics-specific formats
  - Star Micronics Extended ESC/POS (UTF-8)
  - Starprnt
  - Stargraphic

### Non-Features & Limitations

- **No support for wire protocols** such as USB, Bluetooth, etc. This gem is intended
  to run on a server; it only generates  the instructions/bytes to be sent to the client
- (browser, iOS, etc.) which should then send it to the end device.
  - **PR welcome** if someone wants to add USB/Bluetooth support.
- **Pixel-only printer support (Stargraphic) is rudimentary and slow**, because
  it uses system-side font rendering ([Pango](https://www.pango.org/)) to generate
  the image data.
  - **PR welcome** to use a different approach and/or make it faster.
- Table formatting support not yet added. **PR welcome**.
- Indian ISCII encoding for Escpos is not yet supported. **PR welcome**.

## How to Use

### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'thermal'
```

### Formatting your Output

#### Procedural code

Intended API: (needs to be further extracted)

```ruby
printer = Thermal::Printer.new(device: :espon_tm_t88v)
printer.text('Contra felicem vix deus vires habet')
printer.align_center
printer.text('Quam vellem nescire litteras!')
printer.flush # todo: #print!?
```

#### DSL

You can also use it as a DSL:

```ruby
# TODO: Example text should look like an actual receipt
class MyChitPrinter
  include Thermal::Dsl

  def initialize
    @printer = Thermal::Printer.new(device: :espon_tm_t88v)
  end

  def print
    thermal_print do # TODO: does this flush automatically?
      bold do
        text('Contra felicem vix deus vires habet')
        align(:center) do
          text('Quam vellem nescire litteras!')
        end
        # html do
        #
        # end
        # html('<b>foo</b>')
      end
    end
  end
end
```

#### HTML Conversion

```ruby
# TODO: float/tables?
# h1
# h2
# h3
# 
```


### Integrating in an app

- Add details of how to implement a thermal printer config.

### Thread-Safety

- Config loading is thread safe.
- Don't call the same `Thermal::Printer` object from multiple threads.
  You're gonna have a bad time.

### TODOs

Required before releasing.
- [ ] Yaml safe load
- [ ] Add task to import config from escpos-printer-db
- [ ] Rename CjkEncoding to RubyEncoding, rename CharmapEncoding, CharsetEncoding, also add IconvEncoding
- [ ] Encoding classes themselves should validate missing char (move from Escpos::Buffer class)
- [ ] Iconv config generator rake task.
- [ ] Set output format for thermal_print (default, base64, bytes, etc.)
- [ ] Params for escpos: :codepages, escpos: charsets
- [ ] Copy in Escpos and EscposImage gems
- [ ] Param pass-thru to EscposImage
- [ ] Configurability of tmp path -- specific to stargraphic (?) -- Should use Tempfile
- [ ] Write Readme
- [ ] DslMixin should include protocol (?), ipp_uri (?) -- why??
- [ ] Specs for all classes, including base.
- [ ] Remove UNF with and replace with ruby unicode?
- [ ] StarGraphic needs multiple message buffering. ???
- [ ] Add QR to DSL

Nice to haves:
- [ ] font support. col_width should be dynamic in the printer (currently depends on font 0)
- [ ] Copy "Available methods" from https://github.com/escpos/escpos-php
- [ ] Add HTML command in addition to text. Should be done as an AST (HtmlAst) like [[:text, 'ddd'], [:underline, 2, [[:text, 'foo']]]]
- [ ] Optional HTML image support
- [ ] Copy TestReport
- [ ] Stargraphic needs much better buffer support, including line break splitting + multiple buffers.
- [ ] Allow pass-in of codepage object.
- [ ] Allow pass-in of charset object.
- [ ] Indian ISCII encoding for Escpos (separate gem?).

# Contributing
